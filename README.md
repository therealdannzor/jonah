# Jonah Chain

### About
Jonah Chain is a continuation of a tutorial on how to build a blockchain with C++ as seen [here](https://github.com/teaandcode/TestChain). This short and sweet tutorial, which I can recommend to anyone new to blockchains, demonstrates the principle of [mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency#Mining) using the [consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)) algorithm [proof-of-work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work) and a few of the fundamental building blocks of a chain such as a _block_, a _hashing algorithm_, and the _blockchain_ itself. All essential components of a functioning blockchain. While a great starting point to get into blockchain, I felt that there was a very wide gap between understanding such tutorials and jumping into live cryptocurrency source code such as [bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin). This is an attempt to fill that gap for educational purposes.
